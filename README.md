# convert-to-mp4
A Windows batch script to convert videos to MP4 for web streaming.

You will need to define the path to the Windows version of ffmpeg.  Then, you can simply drop a number of video files on the batch file icon and it will convert each of them to a web version in MP4 format.  

Included in the batch file are other ffmpeg commands to do other versions of the MP4 including one to scale output video to 720x480.  If you would rather use one of these, simply uncomment the line and use it instead.
